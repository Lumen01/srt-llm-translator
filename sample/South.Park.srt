Ah, God!

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,322
I'm just taking
your blood pressure, Eric.

6
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:22,990
It's too tight. Stop.

7
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:24,558
(air hisses)

8
00:00:24,658 --> 00:00:26,427
Ms. Cartman,
I'm extremely worried

9
00:00:26,527 --> 00:00:28,262
about your son's health.

10
00:00:28,362 --> 00:00:30,264
His blood pressure,
his cholesterol.

11
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,266
I think it's time
for some drastic measures

12
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:33,767
to bring down his weight.

13
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:35,803
Oh, God, here we go
with this shit again.

14
00:00:35,903 --> 00:00:38,406
Doctor, we try to have Eric
eat right and exercise,

15
00:00:38,506 --> 00:00:41,409
but it just doesn't seem
to work for him.

16
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:43,677
Well, there might be
another answer.

17
00:00:43,777 --> 00:00:46,647
Have you heard of semaglutides?

18
00:00:47,881 --> 00:00:49,117
Semaglutides?

19
00:00:49,217 --> 00:00:51,085
They're the active ingredient
in Ozempic,

20
00:00:51,185 --> 00:00:53,221
a drug originally made
for people with diabetes

21
00:00:53,321 --> 00:00:54,888
but we've now discovered

22
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:58,092
they can help obese people
lose vast amounts of weight.

23
00:00:58,192 --> 00:01:00,461
Really?

24
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:02,062
It's a whole new era
of medicine.

25
00:01:02,163 --> 00:01:03,631
A miracle, really.

26
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:07,635
Young man, how would you like
to not be fat anymore?

27
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:12,273
Not be fat anymore?

28
00:01:12,373 --> 00:01:13,974
Me?

29
00:01:14,074 --> 00:01:15,976
Not fat anymore?

397
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:45,872
Towelie. Towelie.
You're not gonna believe this.

398
00:16:45,972 --> 00:16:49,342
Dude, have you ever done
GLP-1 peptides?

399
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:51,178
GLP pep what now?

400
00:16:51,278 --> 00:16:53,613
There's these new,
crazy drugs people are doing.

401
00:16:53,713 --> 00:16:56,316
It's like cocaine and molly
mixed together.

402
00:16:56,416 --> 00:16:58,251
They make women go crazy.

403
00:16:58,351 --> 00:16:59,419
No, really?

404
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:01,954
Yeah. Last night I was partying

405
00:17:02,055 --> 00:17:03,390
with nine hot MILFs,

406
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:05,525
and this morning I woke up,
and guess what.

407
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:07,294
I don't feel like total shit.

408
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:08,961
It's like a miracle drug.

409
00:17:09,062 --> 00:17:11,864
You partied all night and
felt fine the next morning?

410
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,233
Totally fine.

411
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:14,867
There's, like,
nothing wrong with me.
